    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This app is developed and mantained <strong>for free</strong> by Gianmarco Laggia and Alberto D'Este. It is released for <em>educational purpose only</em> and should not be use to play Niantic's game Pokemon Go.
    </p>
    <p>Ideating and programming this application is a big deal, it's <em>time consuming and quite difficult</em>.
        <br>We are receiving many requests for new features and bug fixing and we are quite busy trying to keep everything on track.</p>
